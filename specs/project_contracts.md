# Project Contracts

## Purpose
- Define the required behavior surface for implementation and validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Research artifacts include `RESEARCH_SUMMARY`, `CODEBASE_MAP`, `DEPENDENCY_RESEARCH`, `COVERAGE_MATRIX`, and `STACK_SNAPSHOT`.
- Implementation plan includes semantic actionability and measurable outcomes.

## Quality Gates
- Build gate requires explicit build checks and consensus pass.
- No blocking build prerequisites remain before phase transition.
